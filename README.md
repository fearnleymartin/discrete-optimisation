# discrete-optimisation
Python solutions for shortest path, knapsack and travelling salesman problems with approximation heuristics

DO_task1_2016 concerns shortest path problems (Djikstra, breadth first search, Bellman Ford)

DO_task2_2016 concerns knapsack solution (Dynamic programming - bottom up/top down approaches, branch and bound with depth first and best first search

DO_task3_2016 concerns travelling salesman (Nearest neighbors, TwoOpt swap, simulated annealing)
